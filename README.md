## 👋 About Me

Hey! I'm Siva Sudhamsh — a developer who enjoys figuring things out, breaking them (accidentally), and fixing them again (on purpose 😄).

I'm currently exploring and building projects with a mix of **web development** and **core programming languages**. Whether it's a backend issue, a C# desktop app, or a good old logic puzzle, I'm up for the challenge.

What I love:
- Writing clean, logical code that just works 🧠
- Solving problems (even when they keep me up late)
- Switching between web dev and system-level code when I need a break

### 🛠️ Tech I Work With

- **Languages:** Java, Python, C, C#  
- **Web & Tools:** XAMPP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Problem Solving:** DSA, competitive coding, algorithmic thinking  
- **Other Interests:** Debugging weird bugs, experimenting with new tools, and building cool side projects just for fun

### 🚀 Currently Learning

- Full-stack development  
- Improving my system design and architecture understanding  
- Building better problem-solving strategies for coding competitions
